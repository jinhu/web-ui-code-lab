# Dart Web Components Code Lab

This is a codelab to show you how to use Web Components in Dart. It's a
continuation of the Google IO 2012 Dart Code Lab
(https://github.com/dart-lang/io-2012-dart-code-lab); you should do that
codelab first.

This was originally built for a workshop to be held at jscamp.asia in November
2012.
