# Dart Web UI Code Lab

This is a codelab to show you how to use Web Components and the Dart Web UI
package. It's a continuation of the Google IO 2012 Dart Code Lab
(https://github.com/dart-lang/io-2012-dart-code-lab); you should do that
codelab first.

This was originally built for a workshop held at jscamp.asia in November 2012,
but it has subsequently been updated.
